# Basketball-Players-Stats-Analysis
Analysised a basketball dataset and calculated, field goal accuracy, three point accuracy, free throw accuracy, averrage points scored per minute for each player, overall shooting accuracy of each player, average number of blocks per game and the average number of steals per game for each player in each season and then after calculating then compiled them into a list of the top 100 players in each catagory.

## a) Purpose of the Program(s):

    The purpose of this program was to do several calulations while ranking player in the top 100.
    
    The following modules that were used for the project only consisted of:
    Random
    Time
    String
    numpy (Main focus in the project)

## b) Input:

    The program takes the following inputs:
        A '.csv' file that contained the data needed.
        How many do you want to rank up to 100.
        
        
## c) Expected Output:

    The expected output was calculating each of the prompts, and then returning them listed of 100 players right after.
    Outputs came back as expected with minor hickups reguarding some variable placements.
    
## d) Type of Execution:

        Sequential Execution: The code is executed in a linear order from top to bottom.

    The program:
    Calculated field goal accuracy, three point accuracy, and free throw accuracy.
    Other calculations after done in sequancal order as I have mention at the start with there lists following them within the same funtion.
    Last, was the first 3 calculations reciving there list like the others prior.

## e) Possible Improvements:

    The program could be improved by:
    1. The orginization of the codes and when it was excecuted could have be more clean.
    2. Made calculation and listing more casual/direct.
    3. Do more research reguarding basketball to understand the true value of the calculations done.
